# Lab 1: Data Formats & Databases 

In this assignment, we will download and format genome, annotation, and RNA-seq data from public databases and repositories. These data will be the basis of some of your future assignments.

## 1. Genome  

1. You will be assigned a plant species in class to work on.
2. Using the public databases discussed in Lab Lecture #2, download the genome fasta and corresponding gene annotations for your assigned species.  
3. Upload these data to MSU HPCC.
4. If the files are compressed, uncompress them.
5. Take a screenshot of the downloaded files and the first 10 lines of each file. Rename the screenshot. Place these in the github repository PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment1  

## 2. RNA-seq data  

1. Identify a set of drought RNA-seq experiments for your assigned species. These must include a control and drought treatment, with at least two replicates per treatment.  
2. Download the SRR files to the MSU HPCC.  
3. Convert to a gzipped fastq format. 
4. Take a screenshot of the downloaded files and the first 10 lines of only one of the fastq files. Place the screenshot in PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment1  

## 3. Methods  

1. Briefly describe the methods you used to download and convert the files for sections #1 & #2 in a text file named "methods.txt". Place methods.txt in PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment1  
2. Push your PLB812 repository to github.
